Here is the practical details 

Create API named matchPattern with 2 inputs, pattern and string.  Call API on any page with two input box for those two inputs and show output true or false. 

Input Pattern : pattern will have total 5 chars and will not have more than three same characters e.g abacb,xzyxy,wzyzw

Input String : string will not have more than 5 words and will have maximum 3 same words.
e.g cat dog cat got dog , Hi Ho Hello Hi Hello

We have to match string with pattern and return true if pattern match , user cna enter any string with above format and any pattern as per given example.

So if pattern is  abacb and  string is "cat dog cat got dog" than on page it should show result true , means its matched. Note user will enter both text pattern and string.
 
So in screen there will be 2 input box , one for Enter Pattern and one for Enter String , add one button when we click on it it will show result true/false on screen
